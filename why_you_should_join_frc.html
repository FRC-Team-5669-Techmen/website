                    is a robotics competition held in countries all around the
                    globe.
                    For the first 6 weeks of every year, teams design,
                    manufacture, and program robots to complete the challenge
                    given by FIRST.
                    They then compete against each other for recognition,
                    awards, and scholarships.
                    <br><br><p style="text-align: center !important;">Now, lets
                        get into why you should join us.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Industry Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="important-p">Joining an FRC team gives you a
                        large amount of experience in many fields pertaining to
                        engineering.</span>
                    During build season, when on the Mechanical / Design team,
                    you learn how to safely use drills, saws, mills, and
                    grinders.
                    You learn how to prepare and test CAD Designs and how to
                    manufacture them.
                    You also gain skills in talking to vendors and manufacturers
                    in order to meet what your team needs.
                    On the Software / Electrical side, you gain unmatched
                    experience in Java programming,
                    which is one of the most widely used languages in Software
                    Engineering.
                    You learn how to write smart, efficient code, and how to
                    properly use version control software,
                    setting you leagues above the rest. On a grander scale, you
                    can learn and experience what it’s like to be a leader,
                    and how to manage projects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="important-p">At every FRC Tournament, there are
                        always many adults from fields of engineering and
                        science
                        that help with volunteering, judging, or some that act
                        as mentors, coaches, or sponsors. </span>
                    These tournaments are a great way to start networking, along
                    with gaining general wisdom and knowledge
                    that would be hard to get elsewhere.

                    <span class="important-p">Being on an FRC Team gives you
                        experience not many others have.</span>
                    When applying to colleges, this experience will set you a
                    step above the rest,
                    allowing you to shine out among the competition. This is
                    especially helpful
                    when applying to a school in the field of engineering.

                        else can get.</span>
                    Each year FIRST gives out scholarships to students who
                    participate in FIRST competitions.
                    Regardless of if you have only been on a team for a year or
                    for several,
                    there are a plethora of scholarships available for you to
                    get.
                    There is a scholarship for everyone when on an FRC team.

                <p>Teams have spirit. Lots of it. Each and every one of us is
                    proud of our creation, and we are all ready to show it
                    through our clothing, our competition pit, and rooting for
                    our robot. At competitions, stadiums are filled with
                    festivity and excitement. People are cheering loudly for
                    their teams, rooting for the drivers, and that their robot
                    may come out at the top.

                    <br>
                    Along with this, during build season you bond with your
                    team. For hours on end you are with each other working
                    towards a common goal: making the best <span data-glitch data-glitch-shake data-glitch-randomize></span>ing robot you
                    can. We plan to have potlucks, barbecues, and events
                    exclusive to FRC members, celebrating the hard work put into
                    the season and competition. This hard work comes with
                    challenges, but conquering these challenges fills you with
                    motivation, drive, and excitement. During the process, you
                    may learn things about yourself you never knew before, learn
                    about interests you didn’t know you had, or learn skills you
                    didn’t know you needed to know. FRC is filled with a world
                    of opportunity, and it’s up to you - and your team - to find
                    them.
